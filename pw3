Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the  range of 1 to 25. 
Def is used to create afunction
def odd() : 
    oddnum=[]
    for i in range(1,26):
        if i%2!=0:
            oddnum.append(i)
    return(oddnum)

Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs to  demonstrate their use. 
*args is used to have n number of arguments in form of different data types
**kwargs is used to have data types but to perform in terms of dictionary means the return of this type of function will be in he form of key and value 

def kwargs_example(**kwargs):
    print("Keyword Arguments:")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(key, ":", value)
def args(*args):
    return args
args(1,2,3,4,5)


Q3.  What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method  used for iteration. Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,  18, 20]. 
In Python, an iterator is an object that allows iteration over a sequence of elements. It provides a way to access the elements of a container one by one
Q4.  What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator  function.

In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that generates a sequence of values using the yield keyword. Unlike regular functions that use the return statement to return a value and end the function execution, generator functions can pause and resume their execution, allowing them to produce a series of values over time. 
def even(n):
    for i in range(1,n):
        if i%2==0:
            yield i
evennum=even(10)
for num in evennum:
    print( num)

Q5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the  first 20 prime numbers.
